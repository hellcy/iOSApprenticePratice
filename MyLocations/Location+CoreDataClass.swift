    // to make Location conforms to the MKAnnotation protocol, we need 3 properties: coordicate, title and  subtitle. These variables are all associated with a block of code, they are read-only computed properties, they don't actually store a value in a memory location until you access to them, then they perform their code blocks. They are read-only because they only return a value, you can't assign new values to them.
